# Warehouse wreckage

Warehouse wreckage is my first project in Unreal 5. I did it while learning the basic of this engine with the courses "Unreal 5 C++ Developper: Learn C++ and make video games" on Udemy. 

# How to Play:

Objective: Your mission is simple - eliminate targets and unleash chaos by shooting balls to destroy the interior of the warehouse (carefull you only have 20 balls).

Controls: Use the intuitive controls to aim and adjust your shooting trajectory. Fire away by pressing the spacebar.
